Another obstacle to leadership development is resistance to change. It can be difficult to break out of old habits and try new approaches to leadership.

### Strategies for Overcoming Resistance to Change

* Seek feedback: Seek feedback from colleagues and team members to identify areas for improvement and set goals.
* Start small: Start with small changes to build momentum and confidence in trying new approaches.
* Be open-minded: Approach new ideas and approaches with an open mind and a willingness to learn.

Leadership development can also be hindered by a lack of support from colleagues and superiors. Without support, it can be difficult to make meaningful progress.

### Strategies for Overcoming Lack of Support

* Build relationships: Build strong relationships with colleagues and superiors to gain their support and buy-in for your development efforts.
* Communicate your goals: Clearly communicate your goals and aspirations to colleagues and superiors to gain their support.
* Seek mentors: Seek out mentors and coaches who can provide guidance and support.
